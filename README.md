The agricultural industry faces several challenges, including unpredictable weather conditions, pests and diseases, and fluctuating market prices. 
Farmers often struggle to decide which crops to grow and when to sell them, which can result in lower yields and financial losses.

To address this problem, we propose a web application that uses machine learning to predict the crop suitable for growing by a farmer and the market price prediction. 
In addition, the application provides a platform for vendors to post advertisements for soon-to-expire produce, which can help reduce food waste and provide an opportunity for restaurant owners to purchase fresh produce at a lower cost.

The system will be designed to be user-friendly, providing farmers and vendors with an easy-to-use interface to input data and receive recommendations. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to provide accurate predictions for farmers and vendors, helping them make informed decisions about which crops to grow and when to sell them. Ultimately, we hope to support sustainable agriculture and reduce food waste, 
while also providing economic benefits for farmers and vendors.
